# ABOUT ME

Hello, I'm Yiying Pan (also call me Starry). I am an undergraduate student majoring in **psychology** (cognitive neuroscience track) and minoring in  **Intensive Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship**(One of the Chu Kochen Honors College minor) at the Zhejiang University, China (ranks 47nd in QS ranking). I'm expected to graduate in June, 2025.

## My Research

My research interests lie in **Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems, and Marketing**, where I aspire to blend computer science and data science with psychological theories to solve real-world problems. I am now applying to Ph.D. and M.Phil. programs to deepen my expertise in these fields.

I worked as a supervised researcher both in Huawei Human Factors Engineering Laboratory (PI: [Prof. Zaifeng Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zaifengg)) and [NEXT lab](https://www.bing.com/search?q=zhangkejun%20NEXT%20lab&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=zhangkejun%20next%20lab&sc=7-19&sk=&cvid=41A7060B09564297B06BF0BBE29553B7&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=)(PI: [Prof. Kejun Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangkejun)). 

I served as a research assistant for one year in Professor [Weihua Zhou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/whzhou)’s research group at the School of Management, Zhejiang University, and also participated in a summer research program at North Carolina State University(PI: [Prof. Edgar Lobaton](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ejlobato/)). Currently, I am working as a research assistant for Associate Professor [Shubin (Lance) Yu](https://www.shubinyu.com/home), who is a faculty member at BI Norwegian Business School. 

In addition, I am conducting an independent research project for my graduation thesis, titled “How Social Media Shapes Superiority: The Mediating Role of In-Group Preference and Out-Group Bias” (Advisor: [Prof.  Zhang Meng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/mz)). This study integrates cognitive psychology experimental methods, such as the Implicit Association Test, along with content analysis techniques.

## My Personality

I am from [Wenzhou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B8%A9%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82), Zhejiang, a warm and charming city rich in community spirit. With an **ENFP** personality type, I thrive in social environments and actively engage with communities on platforms like CC98, Duoduo, WeChat, and Little Red Book. While I may be more reserved in person, I find great joy in conversing with individuals from diverse academic backgrounds, believing that the collision of different ideas fosters creativity and innovation. I consider myself sensitive and unique and I enjoy observing human behavior to better understand the world around me. Even in my twenties, I still have a deep love for life, literature, and art. I am filled with curiosity about the world. I aspire to be like Steve Jobs, someone who truly accomplishes things that change the world.

## My Interests

- **Food:** Delicious food is a significant aspect of my life. I frequently dine at restaurants such as Qingcai, Green Tea, Haidilao, and Meatbenjia. I have explored various chain establishments in Xixi Tianjie and YinTai, with favorites including Goodme grape tea and Chagee’s Spring Peach drink. 
- **Literature and Music:** My cultural interests include Song Ci poetry, particularly the works of Su Shi, and I enjoy music from artists like Yin Lin and Huang Shifu, alongside a variety of contemporary pop musicians. As a dedicated user of NetEase Cloud Music, I also enjoy karaoke, even if my singing isn’t always on pitch.
- **Travel:** I also have a great passion for traveling. So far, I have traveled alone to over 30 cities across the country, experiencing the unique local customs and cultures of different places.
- **Photography**: I've recently been learning about photography, and I enjoy capturing portraits and beautiful natural landscapes. During the summer of 2024, I participated in a photography course co-organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Canon China, and I had the opportunity to showcase my work in an exhibition. You can also check out my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS80MukI5_iutNYooSV-2bqP8B43I-OF/view?usp=sharing).
- **Art**: I've loved art since I was a child. I'm fascinated by the combination of colors, and I learned traditional Chinese painting when I was younger. Now, I'm learning oil painting.

Looking ahead, I am contemplating a cross-disciplinary pursuit in Information Systems, while also considering a focus on quantitative social science within my major. My aspiration is to contribute positively to societal progress and economic development, rather than viewing profit as the sole purpose of my endeavors.
