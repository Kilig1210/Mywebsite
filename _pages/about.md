# **Yiying** PAN

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Psychology** (Cognitive Neuroscience track) and minoring in the **Intensive Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship** (a minor offered by Chu Kochen Honors College) at Zhejiang University, China (ranks 47nd in QS ranking). I am expected to graduate in June 2025.

Welcome to know more about my in my [blog](https://kilig1210.github.io/).

## Research

My research interests encompass **Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems, and Marketing**. I aim to integrate computer science and data science with psychological theories and methodologies to address real-world challenges. Currently, I am applying to Ph.D. and M.Phil. programs to further my expertise in these areas.

I have had the privilege of working as a supervised researcher in the Huawei Human Factors Engineering Laboratory under the guidance of [Prof. Zaifeng Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zaifengg) and in the [NEXT lab](https://www.bing.com/search?q=zhangkejun%20NEXT%20lab&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=zhangkejun%20next%20lab&sc=7-19&sk=&cvid=41A7060B09564297B06BF0BBE29553B7&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=) with [Prof. Kejun Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangkejun).

I also served as a research assistant for one year in the research group of [Prof. Weihua Zhou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/whzhou) at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. Additionally, I participated in a summer research program at North Carolina State University under the supervision of [Prof. Edgar Lobaton](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ejlobato/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant for Associate Professor [Shubin (Lance) Yu](https://www.shubinyu.com/home) at BI Norwegian Business School.

Moreover, I am conducting an independent research project for my graduation thesis titled “How Social Media Shapes Superiority: The Mediating Role of In-Group Preference and Out-Group Bias,” advised by [Prof. Zhang Meng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/mz). This study integrates cognitive psychology experimental methods, such as the Implicit Association Test, along with content analysis techniques.

Feel free to explore the details of these and my other projects on the [Projects Page](https://yiying1210.dpdns.org/projects/).

## Personality

I am from [Wenzhou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B8%A9%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82), Zhejiang, a warm and charming city rich in community spirit. With an **ENFP** personality type, I thrive in social environments and actively engage with communities on platforms like CC98, Duoduo, WeChat, and Little Red Book. While I may be more reserved in person, I find great joy in conversing with individuals from diverse academic backgrounds, believing that the collision of different ideas fosters creativity and innovation.

## Entrepreneurship

I consider myself sensitive and unique, enjoying the observation of human behavior to better understand the world around me. Even in my twenties, I still have a deep love for life, literature, and art, and I am filled with curiosity about the world. 

I have been deeply inspired by Steve Jobs' speech at Stanford University, where he spoke about the power of those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. I aspire to be one of those individuals. While I am still exploring which field will mark the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey, I am confident that with more experience and exposure, I will generate innovative and impactful ideas that can make a difference.

## Interests

- **Food:** I am a food enthusiast who loves exploring various culinary delights. I often dine at restaurants like Qingcai, Green Tea, Haidilao, and Meatbenjia. I have also visited numerous chain establishments in Xixi Tianjie and YinTai, with favorites including Goodme's grape tea and Chagee’s Spring Peach drink.
- **Literature and Music:** My cultural interests span Song Ci poetry, especially the works of Su Shi, and music from artists like Yin Lin and Huang Shifu, along with various contemporary pop musicians. As an avid user of NetEase Cloud Music, I also enjoy karaoke, even if my singing isn't always perfect.
- **Travel:** Traveling is a great passion of mine. I have traveled solo to over 30 cities across the country, immersing myself in the unique local customs and cultures of each place.
- **Photography:** Recently, I have been learning photography, focusing on portraits and beautiful natural landscapes. In the summer of 2024, I participated in a photography course co-organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Canon China, and I had the opportunity to showcase my work in an exhibition.
